# Text Extraction From Images

This repo shows how to extract information from images using two OCR agents, Tesseract and [Google Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision?hl=en).

 - Tesseract is free. To install follow the instructions in its [own repo](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
 - Google Cloud Vision is free for the first 1k images, then it runs on a pay-per-use base. For instructions on the installation follow this [link](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs).
